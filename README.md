# AnimalClassifier
Using the Animals10 dataset from Kaggle and building a Convolutional Neural Network to predict an animal type based on its image.

Once you download the file, upload it to Google Colab under the content file. Despite the file containing a large number of images, we end up using a much smaller amount. The 28000 images get reduced to roughly 13000 as we want to ensure that each animal has the same number of images and reduce bias as much as we can. Additionally, make sure to delete both the best weights files if you re-run the code again so old model weights are not stored.
